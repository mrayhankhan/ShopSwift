## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Fresh Green (#64B360) to evoke a sense of freshness and health associated with groceries.
- Background color: Light Beige (#F5F5DC) to provide a clean and neutral backdrop that doesn't distract from the product images.
- Accent color: Warm Orange (#FFA07A) to highlight key actions such as 'Add to Cart' and 'Checkout'.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines, and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text to create a modern and readable design.
- Use clear and simple icons for categories, cart, and shop actions.
- Clean, grid-based layout with clear separation between elements. Use card-based designs for items and shops to maintain order and scannability.
- Subtle animations and transitions to provide feedback on interactions like adding items to the cart or updating quantities.
